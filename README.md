# Week 1 – Smart Irrigation Automation (Rule-Based)

## 📅 Duration
July 2025 – Week 1  
Internship by **Edunet Foundation**

## 📌 Project Title
**Automate Irrigation using Soil Moisture and Weather Data**

## 🔍 Objective
To implement a basic rule-based irrigation control system using simulated soil moisture and rainfall data. The aim is to automate irrigation by deciding whether to turn the water pump ON or OFF based on given conditions.

## ✅ Task Completed in Week 1
- Uploaded a CSV file containing soil moisture and rainfall data.
- Loaded and displayed the dataset using Pandas.
- Implemented a rule-based irrigation control logic using `if-else` conditions:
  - If soil moisture is **below 30** and **no rainfall**, turn **Irrigation ON**
  - Else, turn **Irrigation OFF**
- Displayed irrigation decisions for each record.

## 🧪 Technologies Used
- Google Colab
- Python (Pandas)
